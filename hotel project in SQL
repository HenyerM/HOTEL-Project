-- For this project, It needed to know if Hotels's revenue is growing and if there is any trend in the data

--1 Revenue information segmented by Business


WITH hotel_info as (
--Unifying data within the tables with the information from 2018,2019 and 2020. all of the tables have the same dimensions.
SELECT * FROM dbo.['2018$']
UNION 
SELECT * FROM dbo.['2019$']
UNION 
SELECT * FROM dbo.['2020$'])

-- Grouping the information by revenue
--Revenue = (stays_in_weekend_nights+stays_in_week_nights)*adr where adr is the daily rate cost of the stay
SELECT arrival_date_year, hotel,
ROUND(SUM((stays_in_weekend_nights+stays_in_week_nights)*adr*discount),2) as 'Revenue'
from hotel_info as hi
JOIN  market_segment$ as ms
ON  hi.market_segment = ms.market_segment
-- This is add discount information of the booking based on the market segment.
JOIN dbo.meal_cost$ as mc
ON mc.meal = hi.meal
-- This is add cost of each meal based on the meal type;
GROUP by arrival_date_year,hotel; 

--2 Grouping all information into a one single table for analyzing

WITH hotel_info as (
SELECT * FROM dbo.['2018$']
UNION 
SELECT * FROM dbo.['2019$']
UNION 
SELECT * FROM dbo.['2020$'])

SELECT * 
from hotel_info as hi
JOIN  market_segment$ as ms
ON  hi.market_segment = ms.market_segment
-- This is add discount information of the booking based on the market segment.
JOIN dbo.meal_cost$ as mc
ON mc.meal = hi.meal
-- This is add cost of each meal based on the meal type;


--The tables created can be analyze through a visualization Tool for better understanding of the story line
